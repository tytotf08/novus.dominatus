		<p><span class = "empty"></span>In the year 2050, Novus Dominatus is a city-state that runs on a Democratic Government and an extremely powerful supercomputer. It was founded following the human expansion to the far reaches of the Known Universe and the colonization of many planets, such as Pluto, Garbados, and some of the bigger meteors in the Oort cloud. The particular planet on which <em>N. Dominatus</em> resides is EarT.H.13, the thirteenth planet on which humans have resided over all time. Set on an artificial island built by the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" target = "_blank">Japanese</a> in 2047, <em>N. Dominatus</em> is one of the <em>Alpha</em> Nations, which are the leaders of the thirteen planets colonized by humans. Because of their high position in the country hierarchy, they have an unlimited supply of bCoin, the virtual currency used by every country. The current version of bCoin is bCoin2.13, and a beta bCoin2.13.2. <em>N. Dominatus</em> is the most stable capitalist country to have ever existed, with only 1% of all citizens with incomes below 500 bCoin.</p>
		<h1 id = "government">Government</h1>
		<p>The government of <em>N. Dominatus</em> is, as mentioned before, Democratic. There are five Provinces in Novus Dominatus: <em>New Brooklyn, Yondex, Dominatus, Poweria</em>, and <em>Siato</em>. These each have their own municipal government which function as a small operating part within the whole of <em>N. Dominatus</em>.</p>

		<h2 id = "the-federal-government">The Federal Government</h2>
		<p>The national government of <em>N. Dominatus</em> has three branches: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. All of these perform different functions and are involved in legislation. The three branches are further inspected below, in order of power. The government was established by Anpanman, TytoTF08, and Humbie in December 2049.</p>
		<p>Voting in <em>N. Dominatus</em> takes place in two-week-long elections every five years. Any citizen with a functional ID may vote. Any temporarily exiled or confined citizens may cast their vote, but it has a 75% value when it comes to deciding the winner from the ballots. The previously mentioned supercomputer actually aids all of the federal government in legislation, decision-making, and collection and distribution of data.</p>
		<h3 id = "executive-branch-council">Executive Branch/Council</h3>
		<p>The executive branch of <em>N. Dominatus</em> is a three-person council, with each person having a certain specialty or area of focus. They convene to make the final decision on major legislation, public affairs, and decision-making for the government. Each one earns the title of Prime Minister of their respective areas. There is a PM of Communications, one of Culture and one of Stability. The Ministers can help each other, but still work on their assigned Ministry for most of the time. The current Prime Ministers of Communications, Culture, and Stability are Covy, Anpanman, and TytoTF08. They will serve five year terms from an epoch of 2050. A PM may serve, at most, two terms in a certain position.</p>
		<h3 id = "legislative-branch">Legislative Branch</h3>
		<p>The Legislative Branch is a Parliament that has ten seats, comprising two representatives from each of the five sectors. The provinces all vote for representatives. The person with the most votes is the First Rep. of their province. The person with the second-most amount of votes is the Second Rep. This voting takes place in all of the five sectors, with all of them serving five-year terms. They may serve an unlimited amount of terms.</p>
		<h3 id = "judicial-branch">Judicial Branch</h3>
		<p>The Powerian Judicial Branch comprises two levels of court: Supreme and Premium. Unfortunately, the Premium courts aren't that premium. There is actually one for each of the respective sectors, for a total of five. The Supreme Court resides in our capital sector <em>Poweria</em>. There are three people in the Supreme Court and one person in each of the Premium Courts. Overall, there are eight members of the Judicial Branch. This concludes our descriptions of the Federal Powerian Government.</p>
		<h2 id = "the-provincial-governments">The Provincial Governments</h2>
		<p>The Five Municipal governments of each of our Provinces are bare-bones and made up of very few moving parts. There is only a Province President (the leader of the Province) and the Assistant President. And so we close out our description of all Government.</p>

		<p><span class = "empty"></span>As you already know, <em>N. Dominatus</em> is built on an artificial island. The original function of the land was a giant Japanese military base. However, Japanese government officials decided against this, saying &quot;Do we really want to look <em>that</em> hostile to the rest of the world?&quot; It turns out that they did not. One of the cities in the <a href = "http://invicta.osc1228.com" target = "_blank">Invicta Republic</a>, <em>New Power City</em>, claimed this land under the jurisdiction of Councilman TytoTF08 of the small council that served as the only part of the Municipal government. Upon claiming this island, the NPC officials decided to start fresh, by establishing many levels of government instead of one council. TytoTF08, Anpanman, and Covy were elected to serve at the highest level.</p>
		<p><span class = "empty"></span>However, the bigger issue remained the placement of this new land. Eventually we settled upon a large asteroid that was within the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud" target = "_blank">Oort Cloud</a>, marking the farthest planet away from the original Earth. The Council of Humanity added an atmosphere and oceans. We accepted multiple other countries, such as <em>Novus Gem</em> and even a set of islands: <em>the Costiness Islands</em>.

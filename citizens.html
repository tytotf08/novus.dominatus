			<p>There are currently twelve citizens of Novus Dominatus. Please refer to the List of Citizens below to find a full index of these people. In Novus Dominatus, the people are a huge part of our country, all aiming for the same thing: justice and a utopian society. Most of us follow the principles of <em>Poweria</em>, a belief that everyone has power and perfection in them and can embody it. This results in a citizen of Novus Dominatus being a Powerian. <em>the Book of Poweria</em>, the Powerian constitution as well as honor code, was written all the way back in mid 2027, during the <em>Original Sin of Imperium</em>, when Great Britain claimed Australia, and all other bodies of Land in <em>Oceania</em>, to form Imperial Britain. London was renamed to the <em>Imperial City</em>, New Power City. More detail on this in the Archives, as well as the <em>Poweria</em> page. A major value that all of us Powerians also honor is to give back. "Never accept something for free nor give something for free", states Sir Glitinery Marcuso, the General who lead the Imperium Sin and was the first leader of Imperial City.</p>

# Novus Dominatus

In the year 2050, Novus Dominatus is a city-state that runs on a Democratic Government and an extremely powerful supercomputer. It was founded following the human expansion to the far reaches of the Known Universe and the colonization of many planets, such as Pluto, Garbados, and some of the bigger meteors in the Oort cloud. The particular planet on which _N. Dominatus_ resides is EarT.H.13, the thirteenth planet on which humans have resided over all time. Set on an artificial island built by the [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan) in 2027, _N. Dominatus_ is one of the _Alpha_ Nations, which are the leaders of the thirteen planets colonized by humans. Because of their high position in the country hierarchy, they have an unlimited supply of bCoin, the virtual currency used by every country. The current version of bCoin is bCoin2.13, and a beta bCoin2.13.2. _N. Dominatus_ is the most stable capitalist country to have ever existed, with only 1% of all citizens with incomes below 500 bCoin.

# Government

The government of _N. Dominatus_ is, as mentioned before, Democratic. There are five Provinces in Novus Dominatus: _New Brooklyn, Yondex, Dominatus, Poweria_, and _Siato_. These each have their own municipal government which function as a small operating part within the whole of _N. Dominatus_.

## the Federal Government

The national government of _N. Dominatus_ has three branches: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. All of these perform different functions and are involved in legislation. The three branches are further inspected below, in order of power. The government was established by Anpanman, TytoTF08, and Humbie in December 2049.

Voting in _N. Dominatus_ takes place in two-week-long elections every five years. Any citizen with a functional ID may vote. Any temporarily exiled or confined citizens may cast their vote, but it has a 75% value when it comes to deciding the winner from the ballots. The previously mentioned supercomputer actually aids all of the federal government in legislation, decision-making, and collection and distribution of data.

### Executive Branch

The executive branch of _N. Dominatus_ is a three-person council, with each person having a certain specialty or area of focus. They convene to make the final decision on major legislation, public affairs, and decision-making for the government. Each one earns the title of Prime Minister of their respective areas. There is a PM of Communications, one of Culture and one of Stability. The Ministers can help each other, but still work on their assigned Ministry for most of the time. The current Prime Ministers of Communications, Culture, and Stability are Covy, Anpanman, and TytoTF08. They will serve five year terms from an epoch of 2050. A PM may serve, at most, two terms in a certain position.

### Legislative Branch

The Legislative Branch is a Parliament that has ten seats, comprising two representatives from each of the five sectors. The provinces all vote for representatives. The person with the most votes is the First Rep. of their province. The person with the second-most amount of votes is the Second Rep. This voting takes place in all of the five sectors, with all of them serving five-year terms. They may serve an unlimited amount of terms.

### Judicial Branch

The Powerian Judicial Branch comprises two levels of court: Supreme and Premium. Unfortunately, the Premium courts aren't that premium. There is actually one for each of the respective sectors, for a total of five. The Supreme Court resides in our capital sector _Poweria_. There are three people in the Supreme Court and one person in each of the Premium Courts. Overall, there are eight members of the Judicial Branch. This concludes our descriptions of the Federal Powerian Government.

## the Provincial Governments

The Five Municipal governments of each of our Provinces are bare-bones and made up of very few moving parts. There is only a Province President (the leader of the Province) and the Assistant President. And so we close out our description of all Government.

# Infrastructure

As you already know, _N. Dominatus_ is built on an artificial island. The original function of the land was a giant Japanese military base. However, Japanese government officials decided against this, saying "Do we really want to look _that_ hostile to the rest of the world?" It turns out that they did not. The capital of Imperial Britain, _Imperium City_, claimed this land under the jurisdiction of Councilman TytoTF08 of the small council that served as the only part of the Municipal government. Upon claiming this island, the NPC officials decided to start fresh, by establishing many levels of government instead of one council. TytoTF08, Anpanman, and Covy were elected to serve at the highest level.

However, the bigger issue remained the placement of this new land. Eventually we settled upon a large asteroid that was within the [Oort Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud), marking the farthest planet away from the original Earth. The Council of Humanity added an atmosphere and oceans. We accepted multiple other countries, such as _Novus Gem_ and even a set of islands: _the Costiness Islands_. To view a full map of _N. Dominatus_, click [here](assets/map.n.Dominatus.png).

# Economy

Being a capitalist country, and the most successful on at that, our economy is one of the most stable ones that has ever existed. The government is given 20 out of every 100 bCoin that goes through the currency-processing network in _N. Dominatus_. We are extremely anti- the _Balance Zero_ movement, which aims for an economic state where nobody ever has over zero bCoin. We believe that in a successful country, every has not no balance or low balance but most have moderately high amounts in their account. That is why we succeed. We make sure everyone has what they need to earn a living in the real world, and their children, being of a wealthy family, also have good resources. The cycle continues. Every year, based on changes in economy and predictions as to the future state of our market based on varying factors, the supercomputer designs a curriculum. This logical, feature rich curriculum is one of the things that _N. Dominatus_ takes the most pride in; it nurtures the future. 

The main area of profit for almost all Powerians is the stock market, this being one of the only games where nobody ever really dominates, where everyone can lose and will lose, inevitably. The government makes quite a bit of money from this ever-changing market. Taxes, the previously mentioned 20 out of 100, fall short in average earnings for the government to the stock market earnings by 20%. _Yes_, the government profits directly from the stock market. All money from the stock market goes towards making the citizens' lives better, happier, and even more quality. The taxes are used to resolve non-citizens-relates matters, such as military and foreign exhanges.

# Citizens

There are currently twelve citizens of Novus Dominatus. Please refer to the List of Citizens below to find a full index of these people. In Novus Dominatus, the people are a huge part of our country, all aiming for the same thing: justice and a utopian society. Most of us follow the principles of _Poweria_, a belief that everyone has power and perfection in them and can embody it. This results in a citizen of Novus Dominatus being a Powerian. _the Book of Poweria_, the Powerian constitution as well as honor code, was written all the way back in mid 2027, during the _Original Sin of Imperium_, when Great Britain claimed Australia, and all other bodies of Land in _Oceania_, to form Imperial Britain. London was renamed to the _Imperial City_, New Power City. More detail on this in the Archives, as well as the _Poweria_ page. A major value that all of us Powerians also honor is to give back. "Never accept something for free nor give something for free", states Sir Glitinery Marcuso, the General who lead the Imperium Sin and was the first leader of Imperial City.

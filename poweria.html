			<p><em>Poweria</em> is a belief of N. Dominatus that you can be the best version of yourself, and that the best version of yourself is no better than anyone else' greatest self. Poweria is being this awesome being. Poweria is also what we call the journey towards this state. We believe that a country, such as N. Dominatus, can achieve this. This is the journey from a city built from war - to a nation full of peace.</p>

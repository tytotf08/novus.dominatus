	<h1>POWERIA</h1>
	<p>A state of being, a state of power, a state of perfection.</p>
	<p>The building blocks of civilization as we know it here in <em>N. Dominatus</em> -- </p>
	<p>And the final strike, the one that brought down what we knew on our lone planet, imagining the stars.</p>
	<p>But now we look down at stars, we hold more in our hands, the universe within our reach.</p>
	<p>Long has humanity felt inferior.</p>
	<p>And yet, following the events of the <em>Original Sins of Imperium</em>, we embrace power, perfection, nurture the world, destroy our enemies, and, finally, we <em>live</em>.</p>
	<p>We need not beg, and grovel and be at mercy;</p>
	<p>Instead we are the ones who allow it.</p>
	<p>Humanity has progressed from one small speck in the universe - to <em>Poweria</em>.</p>
	<p>To honor this progression, we learn the history and origins of <em>N. Dominatus</em>.</p>
	<h2>The Original Sins of Imperium(2026)</h2>
	<p>Our story begins at an Britian-Australia convention in Melbourne, late 2026.</p>
	<p>Only three years after elections took place in Great Britain, their leader, Mr. Fletcher William, came to this convention, along with Australian leader Sam McMann. The two talk about creating a unity between the two, when someone whispers something in Mr. William's ear. Nobody know what that was, but what we do know is that it sparked the Original Sins of Imperium, for right after that, the first raid took place.</p>
	<p>The British Army attacked Australia, yelling that it was an offshoot of Britain's people and that it should be their's once more. A series of incredibly sad and violent battles ensued until late 2028. In early 2029, Australia fell on one knee, accepting this in a fit of sadness and desperation for their country.</p>
	<p>This was not a war, but a lengthy massacre. A <em>modern</em> colonization. This destruction is now regarded as the Original Sins of Imperium, due to what it brought to the world; an era of suspicion, paranoia. Many regarded the assistant to Mr. William a death-bringer. He was never seen again, until the Golden age.</p>
	<h2>The Imperial City(2031-2037)</h2>
	<p>The world was still scarred. Only Britain remained unscathed, strong and mighty. They began a new order, a Democracy in a country called Imperial Britain. London was decided the new center of this nation; the <em>Imperial City</em>. Long did the owrld remain like this, for a good six years. In the U.S., however, this were improving. The recent events that had hit them hard, such as Police brutality and Sars-COV-2, were over. It rose to its full height once again, inventng a hover technology and the first ever hoverboards as well as commercial spacecraft. And they are the stars of the next era: <em>Independence</em>.</p>
	<h2>Independence: the Birth of N. Dominatus(2037-2045)</h2>
	<p>The United States was <em>not</em> happy. Who wouldn't be, if someone colonized a whole other continent and was now huge and insane? And so, they did the American way: battle. Yes indeed, the colonizer was now getting colonized (or something like that). So they sent over the troops, and I. Britain wasn't happy. They decided to fight back. A continuation of the Imperium Sins, if you will.</p>
	<p>Another war ensued, but this one was much quicker, only lasting one year. America beat the bollocks out of I. Britain and attempted to aid the Australians by shipping them to their home and spreading them all over I. Britain. Two Australians from I. City, Bosh Benji Baxter and Grumbie S. Iu, decided to make I. City independent. TytoTF08, an American who was helping clean up by doing the maths of the operation, joined them. They went to Japan, where they'd had a disc that was to be military base, and claimed it. They wrote a book, the book of <em>Poweria</em>. They, along with the Council of Humanity (Americans in Space and on Earth and Asian and African countries) settled on a meteor in the <a href = "https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud" target = "_blank">Oort Cloud</a>.</p>
	<h2>The Golden Era(2045-present)</h2>
	<p>Along with the restoration of Australia came the creation of a new era. Poweria was something everyone honored, though it was not always named. Many had practiced it in previous years, but now everyone did. Everyone believed in utopia, everyone hoped, helped, loved, and was powerful in their society.</p>

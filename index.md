In the year 2050, upon Pluto moon Charon resides the Democratic country Novus Dominatus. Formed following the Easter Conquest of 2027, it remains one of the most exemplary and developed extraterrestrial nations. Partially maintained by a supercomputer and policed by drones, its justice systems are widely revered.


Originally the 52nd state of the United States of America following recognition of Long Island's independence, Novus Dominatus became a widely recognized nation in 2030, seeing its power and influence. To this day, trading is prolific between the two nations.

Known for its preservation and mass-reproduction of natural resource, aforementioned, as well as relations with Germany and China, lowered the poverty line of Novus Dominatus, creating a land of opportunity; a second and more *novel* American dream.

## Geography

Charon, upon discovery, was partially rebuilt and many characteristics of Earth were implanted. For practicality, hydrogen was extracted. The process, having been executed before in conditions much less humane, took relatively little time; settling began in 2028. 

Novus Dominatus occupies the entirety of Charon's surface, with one half occupied by people, and one third containing factories. The remainder is kept in void as extra space.

		<p>Being a capitalist country, and the most successful one at that, our economy is one of the most stable ones that has ever existed. The government of Novus Dominatus is given 20 out of every 100 bCoin that goes through the currency-processing network in <em>N. Dominatus</em>. We are against the <em>Balance Zero</em> movement, aiming for an economic state where nobody ever has over zero bCoin. We believe that in a successful country, every has not no balance or low balance but high amounts in their account. That is why we succeed. We make sure everyone has what they need to earn a living in the real world, and their children, being of a wealthy family, also have good resources. The cycle continues. Every year, based on changes in economy and predictions as to the future state of our market based on varying factors, the supercomputer designs a curriculum. This logical, feature rich curriculum is one of the things that <em>N. Dominatus</em> takes the most pride in.</p>
		<p>The main area of profit for almost all Powerians is the stock market, this being one of the only games where nobody ever really dominates, where everyone can lose and will lose, inevitably. The government makes quite a bit of money from this ever-changing market. Taxes, the previously mentioned 20 out of 100, fall short in average earnings for the government to the stock market earnings by 20%. <em>Yes</em>, the government profits directly from the stock market. All money from the stock market goes towards making the citizens' lives better, happier, and more quality. The taxes are used to resolve non-citizens-relates matters.</p>
